      <h1><strong><ins>Easy Homemade Lasagna</ins></strong></h1> 
     <p class = "first-paragraph"> Is an Italian dish made of stacked layers of thin flat pasta alternating with fillings such as rag√π  (ground meats and tomato sauce) and other vegetables, cheese (which may include ricotta and parmesan), and seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano and basil.The dish may be topped with melted grated mozzarella cheese. Typically, the cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting lasagne casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.I really enjoy this meal because of the mixture of meat and cheese.</p>

    <h3><em>How to Layer Lasagna</em></h3>

    <ul class ="second">
        <li>sauce ‚Äì noodles ‚Äì cheese</li>
        <li>sauce ‚Äì noodles ‚Äì cheese</li>
        <li>sauce ‚Äì noodles ‚Äì cheese</li>

    <h3><em>How Long to Bake</em></h3>
    <p>Baking time lasagna for this recipe is about one hour total. To get that perfect browned cheese topping, you‚Äôll need to bake it in two stages.</p>
    <ol class = "second-order">
        <li>Layer, cover it tightly in foil to retain the moisture.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the foil, top with cheese, and return to the oven for another 15 minutes, or until the top is browned and your easy lasagna is bubbling.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Important Tip:</strong>Let the lasagna sit/rest for at least 15 minutes once removed from the oven (even 30-45 minutes is fine). This will keep it from becoming runny and help it to keep its shape when cut.</p>
    <p><strong>Enjoy! Bon appetit!</strong></p>
